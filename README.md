# Hotel Booking SPA Project üòé

## Description üìù

The Hotel Booking Single Page Application (SPA) is A hotel Reservation Site that Allows you to Find the Desired Hotel Based on your needs and Conditions from the Main List of Hotels or the Filtered List or add the Desired Hotel from the Map to the Bookmark List;

Also, Each User can have his Own List of Bookmarks and Hotels and Manage his Own List of Bookmarks. (Delete, Edit or Add a Bookmark.)

In This Project, For the Create of Different Routes (Pages), React Router DOM is used, Which Naturally Creates a Much Better User Experience, on the Other Hand
To Provide a Beautiful User Interface, a Local Database is Used to Manage and Organize the Information of Hotels and Bookmarks.

This is an Application Developed with the React.js Library,
On the other hand, This Project is Set up with Vite.

I am currently working on optimizing the app codes
